# EnterThePassword
This repository contains a simple password entry system written in C. The program allows users to input a password with masked characters for security and verifies it against a predefined password.
Features
Password Masking: As users type the password, each character is masked with an asterisk (*) to enhance security.
Backspace Handling: Users can use the backspace key to correct mistakes while entering the password.
Password Validation: The entered password is compared against a predefined password, and access is granted or denied accordingly.
